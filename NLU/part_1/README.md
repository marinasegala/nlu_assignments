**This file is not mandatory**

But if you want, here your can add your comments or anything that you want to share with us
regarding the exercise.

-----

The delivery must follow the directory schema that you can find in exam/studentID_name_surname.zip.

The LM and NLU folders contain two sub-folders one for part 1 and the other for part 2, while for SA there is only part 1. Inside them, there are the following files and folders: main.py, functions.py ,  utils.py,  model.py,  README.md, /dataset and /bin.

- utils.py : you have to put all the functions needed to preprocess and load the dataset
model.py: the class of the model defined in PyTorch.
- functions.py: you have to write all the other required functions (taken from the notebook and/or written on your own) needed to complete the exercise.
- main.py: you have to write the calls to the functions needed to output the results asked by the exercise.
- README.md: you may want to write a message for us related to your solution (optional).
- /dataset: the files of that dataset that you used.
- /bin: the binary files of the best models that you have trained.
- 
The reports have to be placed in the corresponding projects folders i.e. into the folders LM, NLU and SA.

Last but not least, the code has to be well-written and documented with comments. Furthermore, the script has to run without bugs otherwise the exercise will not be evaluated. Jupyter notebooks are not accepted.
